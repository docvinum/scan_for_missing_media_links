# WordPress Media Checker

A Python script to automatically scan WordPress articles and identify missing PDF links.

## Overview

This script is designed to traverse articles on the WordPress site `https://ives-openscience.eu/`, specifically checking articles from `/1/` to `/100000/`. For each article, the script checks for a specific link (with the ID `publication-pdf`) to see if it points to a missing PDF. Any detected missing PDF links, along with the corresponding article links, are logged into a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` and `beautifulsoup4` Python packages. These can be installed using pip:
  ```bash
  pip3 install requests beautifulsoup4
  ```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR REPOSITORY LINK]
   cd [YOUR REPOSITORY NAME]
   ```

2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python3 check_media.py
   ```

3. Once the script completes its execution, check the `missing_media.csv` file for results.

## Features

- Automatically scans through specified range of articles.
- Identifies and logs missing PDF links and corresponding article links.
- Implements delay between requests to avoid server overload.
